[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Qihoo360/phptrace.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Qihoo360/phptrace)

phptrace is a low-overhead tracing tool for PHP.

It can trace all PHP executing, function calls, request information during
run-time. And provides features like Filter, Statistics, Current Status and so
on.

It is very useful to locate blocking, heavy-load problems and debug in all
environments, especially in production environments.

Features:
* low-overhead, when extension loaded and trace is off
* stable, running on [Qihoo 360](http://www.360safe.com/) and tested on main-stream frameworks

Building
------------------------------

1. Extracting tarball
    ```
    tar -zxf phptrace-{version}.tar.gz
    cd phptrace-{version}
    ```

2. PHP extension - Build & Install
    ```
    cd extension
    {php_bin_dir}/phpize
    ./configure --with-php-config={php_bin_dir}/php-config
    make
    make install
    ```

3. PHP extension - Add extension load directive

    Edit `php.ini`, add the following line. A reload is needed if PHP running
    by php-fpm.

    ```
    extension=trace.so
    ```

4. Command tool - Build & Install
    ```
    make cli
    make install-cli
    ```

5. Verify
    ```
    php -r 'for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) usleep(10000);' &
    phptrace -p $!
    ```

    You should see something below if everything fine

    ```
    1431681727.341829      usleep  =>  NULL   wt: 0.011979 ct: 0.011980
    1431681727.341847      usleep(10000) at [Command line code:1]
    1431681727.353831      usleep  =>  NULL   wt: 0.011984 ct: 0.011983
    1431681727.353849      usleep(10000) at [Command line code:1]
    1431681727.365829      usleep  =>  NULL   wt: 0.011980 ct: 0.011981
    1431681727.365848      usleep(10000) at [Command line code:1]
    ```


Usage
------------------------------

* Trace executing

    ```
    $ ./phptrace -p 3600
    1431682433.534909      run() at [sample.php:15]
    1431682433.534944        say("hello world") at [sample.php:7]
    1431682433.534956          sleep(1) at [sample.php:11]
    1431682434.538847          sleep  =>  0   wt: 1.003891 ct: 0.000000
    1431682434.538899          printf("hello world") at [sample.php:12]
    1431682434.538953          printf  =>  11   wt: 0.000054 ct: 0.000000
    1431682434.538959        say  =>  NULL   wt: 1.004015 ct: 0.000000
    1431682434.538966      run  =>  NULL   wt: 1.004057 ct: 0.000000
    ```

* Print current status

    ```
    $ ./phptrace -s -p 3600

Comparison
------------------------------

### phptrace
* It can print call stack of executing php process, which is similar to pstack.
* It can trace php function calls, which is similar to strace.
* It cannot get performance summary of php scripts, which will be supported in the future.
* It can not debug php scripts.

### Phpdbg
* It is used to debug php program, which is similar to gdb.
* It cannot print call stack of executing php process.
* It cannot trace php function calls.

### Xhprof
* It is used to get performance summary, which is similar to gprof.
* It cannot print call stack of executing php process.
* It cannot trace php function calls.

### Xdebug
* It can print call stack only if some error occurs.
* It would hook many opcode handlers even you did not set the auto_trace flag in php.ini; it traces all the processes at the same time just without output. This is a big overhea
d in production envirenment.
* It can not be enabled to trace without modifying the ini or the php script.
